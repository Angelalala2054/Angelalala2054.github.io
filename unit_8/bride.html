			<p><span>Kylee Marie Macdonald</span> came into this world ahead of schedule on February 16th, 1997.</p>&nbsp
			<p>Kylee was born to be loving, caring, compassionate, and content. She was a quiet girl, loved to play video games, and build forts in the woods with her siblings. Ever the trendsetter, her brother Jon remembers a time she went to school wearing one sandal and one boot. </p>&nbsp
			<p>Her love for friends and family can be seen through her gentle energy, and warm acceptance. Circumstances weren't always kind to Kylee growing up, but her perserverance to overcome obstacles became a strong part of who she is and what makes her so lovely and unique. Kylee has carefully and creatively surrounded herself with a family of those who cherish, respect, and accept her for her beautiful self. Some are members by blood, some are adopted, some are appointed, and some are four-legged. </p>&nbsp
			<p>Kylee is so loveable and genuine. Her delight is contagious and energetic. Kylee's dedication to others is sincere and heartfelt, always. Kylee is loving, loyal, considerate and patient. Her striking beauty is emphasized by the sparkle in her eyes and her dazzling smile.
