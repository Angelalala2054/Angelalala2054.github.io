		<p>Justin Ryan Moore arrived quickly, but right on time, May 8th, 1997.</p>
		&nbsp;
		<p> He was born an only child to be loving, caring, faithful, and witty. The sudden loss of his father provided an early life lesson to Justin about the precious vulnerabilities of life. At a young age he learned to cope with grief and burden using faith, humilty and humor. The family and friends Justin has surrounded himself with have watched him grow, (and grow, and grow...!) into a loving, handsome, responsible young man. </p>
		&nbsp;
		<p>Justin has an excellent memory and has safely stored away years of useful information on topics including movies, comics, basketball, video games, and more! He is smart, and articulate.</p>
		&nbsp;
		<p>Justin's dimples frame a smile that can light up a room. They simply can't be missed. Justin is not afraid to extend a friendly gesture to a stranger. His calm, kind-hearted energy reflects his empathetic soul. Justin is easy to talk to and and is full of good natured playfulness. He is respectful, independent, open minded, honest, and thoughtful.
