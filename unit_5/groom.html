		<p>Justin Ryan Moore arrived right on time, May 8th, 1997.</p>
		&nbsp;
		<p> He was born an only child to be loving, caring, faithful, and witty. The sudden loss of his father, Mark, provided an early leasson to Justin the precious vulnerabilities of life. At an early age he learned to cope with grief and burden using humilty and humor. The family and friends he has surrounded himself with have watched Justin grow, (and grow, and grow...!) into a handsome, responsible young man. His calm, kind-hearted energy reflects his empathetic soul.</p>
		&nbsp;
		<p>Smart and articulate, Justin has an excellent memory and has safely stored away years of useful information on topics including movies, comics, basketball, video games, and more!</p>
		&nbsp;
		<p>Justin's dimples frame a smile that can light up a room. They simply can't be missed. Justin is not afraid to extend a friendly gesture to a stranger. In conversation Justin eases the flow with good natured playfulness. He was raised to be respectful, independent, open minded, honest, and thoughtful.
